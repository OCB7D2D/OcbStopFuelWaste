# OCB Stop Fuel Waste Mod - 7 Days to Die (A20) Addon

A small harmony mod to stop fuel waste in forges, campfires and
chemical stations. Will stop burning fuel when production or melting
is finished. You can still use the station to only produce heat if
you enable the station with nothing to melt or produce in it.

This mod is not EAC (Easy Anti-Cheat) compatible, so turn it off!
