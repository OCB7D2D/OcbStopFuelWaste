# OCB Stop Fuel Waste Mod - 7 Days to Die (A20) Addon

A small harmony mod to stop fuel waste in workstations, campfires and
chemical stations. Will stop burning when production or melting is
finished. You can still use the station to only produce heat if you
enable the station with nothing to melt or produce in it.

This mod is not EAC (Easy Anti-Cheat) compatible, so turn it off!
